   ```bash
   SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN='https://orygoai-online-store.myshopify.com'
   SHOPIFY_API_KEY='example-api_key-1234567890'
   SHOPIFY_API_CLIENT_SECRET='example-api_client_secret-1234567890'
   SHOPIFY_API_AUTH_TOKEN='example-auth_token-abc123'
   ```

## Step 3: Enable API Requests in Your AI Agent's Tasks

Once the Shopify integration is active, you can set up tasks for your AI Agents that require Shopify API interactions.

   - Go to the **Tasks** section and create a new task or select an existing tasks
   - Select **Shopify** from the API integration dropdown.
   - Add the API request details in simple, natural language. For example, you can create a task that enables your AI Agent to retrieve and provide customers with order tracking links.
