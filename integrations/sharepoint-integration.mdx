## Step 2: Set Up SharePoint Integration on OrygoAI

1. **Access the OrygoAI Control Panel**  
   - Navigate to the [OrygoAI Control Panel](https://customersupportagent.app.orygo.ai/home).

2. **Connect OrygoAI to Your SharePoint Site**  
   To connect OrygoAI to your SharePoint site, enter the APP credentials (client_id, tenant_id and client_secret) as well as the site name and site hostname for the SharePoint you want to connect:

   ```bash
    TENANT_ID='example-tenant-id-1234567890'
    CLIENT_ID='example-client-id-1234567890'
    CLIENT_SECRET='example-client-secret-abc123'
    SHAREPOINT_SITE_HOSTNAME='example.sharepoint.com'
    SHAREPOINT_SITE_NAME='example-site-name'
    ```

## Step 3: Upload SharePoint Folders to Your AI Agent's Knowledge Base
    Once the SharePoint integration is active, follow these steps to upload SharePoint folders into your AI Agents’ knowledge base:

    - Go to the Knowledge Base section of the OrygoAI Control Panel.
    - Select SharePoint as the source.
    - Add the URL(s) of your SharePoint folders into the uploader to import them into your AI Agent’s knowledge base.
